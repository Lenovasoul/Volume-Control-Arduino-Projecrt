Volume-Control-Arduino-Project

This program takes input from an ELEGOO IR controller.
When you press the UP button, the volume increases by 1.
When you press the DOWN button, the volume decreases by 1.

This project was written using the Arduino IDE, and the code is written in C/C++

Resources Needed: 
Arduino Uno, USB cable (for Arduino), 16×2 LCD character display
IR receiver module, ELEGOO IR remote controller, Breadboard,
Jumper wires (male-to-male) about 25, 10 kilo ohm resistor (LCD contrast),
and 220 ohm resistor (LCD backlight)

Libraries needed:
Liquid Crystal & IRremote
